# This project is just  another example how we can use "canvas" , "javascript objects concepts " and  some simple yet powerfull 
# Mathematical operations to visualise  PARTICLES  .( THIS TIME AS A "FIREFLY" ) 

THIS IS JUST ADVANCED VERSION OF MY LAST EXPERIMENTS ON  ANIMATIONS USING "HMTL CANVAS API ".
SO , WHAT DOES IT HAVE  MORE THAN FORMER ONE ?
WELL HERE IT IS :

```
1.BIRTH 
  this function gives birth to a new FIREFLY everytime it is invoked , which is just adding a FIREFLY object to an arrays of FIREFLY family.
```
```
2.DIE
 this function  deletes the current FIREFLY once it is invoked , which is just popping out a FIREFLY object from the arrays FIREFLY family.
```
```
3.LIFE_span
 this defines after what time the FIREFLY will die after it has been given birth to.
```
```
MOST AMUSING PART !!

4.Random Path being followed by the FIREFLY is what makes it a CODED PARTICLE  look like something LIVE and REAl.!

# HOW TO USE IT 
```
  *Clone the repo 
  ```
  ```
  *open the directory in terminal
  ```
  ```
  *npm start run 
  ```
  
  # How it Works 
   *when you move your mouse , set of FIREFLY OBJECT is created and DISAPPEARS  after its LIFE_SPAN!
   *Other geometries are also included . just as a random experiment to showcase what potential it bears!
