This project is just  another example how we can use "canvas" , "javascript objects concepts " and  some simple yet powerfull 
Mathematical operations to visualise  PARTICLES  .( THIS TIME AS A "FIREFLY" ) , i have justified why i have termed it as FIREFLY in LINE NO. 21.

THIS IS JUST ADVANCED VERSION OF MY LAST EXPERIMENTS ON  ANIMATIONS USING "HMTL CANVAS API ".
SO , WHAT DOES IT HAVE  MORE THAN FORMER ONE ?
WELL HERE IT IS :

```
1.BIRTH 
  this function gives birth to a new FIREFLY everytime it is invoked , which is just adding a FIREFLY object to an arrays of FIREFLY family.
```
```
2.DIE
 this function  deletes the current FIREFLY once it is invoked , which is just popping out a FIREFLY object from the arrays FIREFLY family.
```
```
3.LIFE_span
 this defines after what time the FIREFLY will die after it has been given birth to.
```
```
MOST AMUSING PART !!

4.Random Path being followed by the FIREFLY is what makes it a CODED PARTICLE  look like something LIVE and REAl.!
